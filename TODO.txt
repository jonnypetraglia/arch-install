Is EFI right? Is it booting?

Selecting a disk that is mounted should throw an error or unmount all partitions on it

go package install not working...

What do if aur package is broken?
    Maybe have a .broken file that I can add to on the fly; anything in it is ignored?



## Dotfiles

How to do dotfiles like fish and such?
    fish_add_path ~/.cargo/bin needs to go  in config.fish
    echo 'function cls; wipe --fps 30 --duration 1000; end' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    .screenrc
    logseq theme

VS Code Extensions should be stored or synced from somewhere else.




### skel?

Most certainly gotta be able to include those with dotfiles....

...but need configurable services?



## Tinytim


Sync dir should be /Sync
    This requires adjusting Tim's syncthing config!!!!!
ytdl dir is /opt/ytdl-web

tinytim needs syncthing.service inside ~/.config/systemd/user/default.target.wants ?


## Starch

xdg-settings set default-web-browser min.desktop

starch needs `exec i3` inside ~/.xinitrc

Script for running pipes: `pipes-rs -c rgb -d 25 -k light,heavy,curved,knobby`



## Bonus
    - greeter-session inside /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf ?
    - code-server.service
